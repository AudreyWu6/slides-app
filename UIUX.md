Application of UI/UX Principles:
1. Consistency: The application maintains consistent design elements across different pages, and has format consistency and consistent color.
2. Feedback: Interactive elements provide immediate and clear feedback. For example, buttons change color when hovered over or clicked, and informative messages are displayed after actions are performed (such as register status, deleting last presentation ...)
3. Hierarchy and Accessibility: Visual and functional hierarchy is used to guide the users through the most common actions, with critical actions made more prominent. ensured that the application is accessible, with keyboard navigability and screen reader support. such as:
    1. we have logout button at all pages,
    2. return EditPresentation page when preview presentation or reorder slides.
4. Simplicity: The layout and interactions are kept simple to avoid overwhelming the users. We employ a minimalist design approach where possible to focus user attention on core functionalities. such as:
    1. put all main functions button at the top of Edit Presentation page, users can see preview/reorder/logout options obviously.
    2. put all toolbars near the slide, user can easily choose different tools using in slide.
5. Optimization of Forms: Forms have been simplified with clear labels and logical grouping of information, which has reduced the time required to fill them out and minimized errors, such as: we have editIcon near title, users can choose update title or thumbnail or together.
6. Responsive Design: Efforts were made to ensure the application is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices. This includes adjustable text sizes, responsive images, and mobile-friendly navigation elements.For example:
    1. the toolbar position and slide area were arranged from horizontal to vertial when change to mobile size.
    2. All the buttons(preview/reorder/logout ...) on the top were change to same size, and aligned in a row, to make them wrapped regularly when screen downsize.
    3. All the card was generated in reasonabel size, make better visual experence.
